        <p>Project Title: Voice Based E-notice Board  Using Android App </p>
        <p> Description- Voice Based Notice Board is very selective term for this project, as it has a very 
            wide scope rather than just being a simple notice board. First we should understand the purpose 
            of this project of this project, in this system we can display a message or notice to some display 
            like LCD, and this message can be easily set or changed from anywhere in the world, just by using 
            the SMS facility of your mobile handset. Whenever notice we want to display just send the SMS of 
            that text. This is very useful in hotels, Malls, College, offices, and can be used anywhere even 
            at home.
